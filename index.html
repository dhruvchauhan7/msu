        The Faculty of Technology and Engineering as it stands today formed alongwith the establishment of the Maharaja
        Sayajirao University in 1949 is an outgrowth of what was popularly known as the "Kala Bhavan Technical
        Institute" (KBTI) established in June 1890 by his late Highness The Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda
        state. In May 1990,it completed 100 years of glorious services for the cause of Technical Education.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Kala Bhavan started its activity in 1890 with the modest but novel objective of producing skilled artisans
        and apprentices by imparting instruction in local language in the following fields:
        <br>
        <br>
        Civil, Mechanical, and Electrical Engineering,Drawing and Printing, Architecture and Photo engraving, Textile
        Chemistry including Dyeing, Bleaching, Sizing & Printing, oil and Soap making etc, With the assistance of German
        experts and foreign trained teacher under the able stewardship of Principal T. K. Gajjar. Other courses on
        Textile Technology(weaving), Furniture making and Fine Arts were started later. Principal C. H. Vora
        consolidated these pioneering efforts into a Polytechnic by starting a variety of Diploma and Certificate
        courses in the above major disciples, with the additional staff, laboratories and buildings. The Polytechnic
        status with steady development continued until 1949 when the Kalabhavan was converted into the Faculty of
        Technology and Engineering (with the establishment of The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, following
        generous donation by the Gaekwads for the University and the New Building of the Institute). From this stage
        onwards, the Institute developed rapidly recognizing no bounds.
        <br>
        <br>
        These hectic developments resulting in creation of 15 departments (Department of Pharmacy was under Faculty of
        Technology and Engineering till 2015), a workshop, a library and several buildings were possible due to the
        financial support mainly from UGC and aided by UNDP, USAID and Government agencies and also due to the dedicated
        efforts by the Institute, Deans and Teachers. Faculty laboratories and departments received massive aid of
        $1,050,000 for development from the United Nations Development Program(UNDP). The aid was given to develop
        infrastructure facilities in the area of Fracture Mechanics, Water Resources and Environmental Engineering,
        Turbojet propulsion and Microprocessor Applications. In 1986, Post Graduate courses on (i) Fracture Mechanics
        (ii) Irrigation Water Management (iii) Turbojet Propulsion and (iv) Microprocessor Applications were introduced.
        <br>
        <br>
        Under USAID program, faculty received a massive grant of Rs. 4 crore from Water Resources Department and Narmada
        Department of Government of Gujarat for development of undergraduate and postgraduate program of Irrigation
        Water Management in March 1991. Constant efforts are made to update curriculum, improve teaching, enhance
        infrastructure and laboratory facilities, promote research and establish linkages with the Society and
        Industries and above all, emphasis on excellence.
        <br>
        <br>
        Under the Quality Improvement Program of Department of Electronics, now called Ministry of Information
        Technology, Department of electrical Engineering and Department of Computer Science received electronic
        equipments, computers and softwares worth Rs. 200 crores. This project was named as IMPACT project and was for
        the improvement of laboratory facilities for under graduate degree program. MIT later on partly supported the
        maintenance of equipments and computers under the sustainability support scheme.
        <br>
        <br>
        The reputed faculty members leave profound influence by their expertise at the major national & international
        conferences, seminars and refresher courses and help shape the future trends in technical education. That our
        Alumni have performed excellently in higher education and in challenging jobs in India and abroad (particularly
        USA) and have achieved higher key positions, bears testimony to the quality of education imparted. The Institute
        is always a preferred choice for a student to become and engineer and for the employer to grab its competent
        engineers for jobs. Thus, it has taken more than a century of dedicated efforts of a few pioneers and
        visionaries to raise the old KALA BHAVAN to the stature of a mighty technical institute in the forefront of
        technical education in the service of the nation. ( Courtesy : Prof. P. B. Desai )
